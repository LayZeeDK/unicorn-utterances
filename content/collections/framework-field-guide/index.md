<p style="width: 1px; flex-grow: 1; flex-shrink: 1; min-width: 350px; font-weight: bold;">Hi! I'm <a href="https://crutchcorn.dev">Corbin Crutchley</a>, the author of "The Framework Field Guide" - the outline of which you're looking at!</p>
</div>

The Framework Field Guide will be available **for free** online alongside paid physical edition and will teach React, Angular, and Vue all at the same time.

> Are you really going to teach React, Angular, and Vue all at once?!

**Yes!**

Because all three of these frameworks have some fairly solid commonality between them, I'm able to have most of the concepts explained in shared headings and text bodies.
For instances where the frameworks diverge, you'll see tabs to see the relevant code samples.

For example, here's a "Hello world" component in each framework:

<!-- tabs:start -->
# React

```jsx
const Hello = () => {
	return <p>Hello, world!</p>
}
```

# Angular

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: "my-app",
  template: `<p>Hello, world!</p>`,
  standalone: true
})
class HelloWorldComp {}
```

# Vue

```vue
<!-- Hello.vue -->
<template>
  <p>Hello, world!</p>
</template>

<script setup>
</script>
```

<!-- tabs:end -->

In the book print, these tabs will be turned into sub-headings.

## Who is this book for?

This book is primarily for three sets of people:

1) Newcomers, who are looking to learn these frameworks for the first time.
2) Engineers who've learned one framework and are looking for an easy way to learn one of the others.
3) Those looking to 1-up their knowledge of these frameworks' internals

This book will be starting with the very basics of what a component is, all the way into re-creating the core elements of
these frameworks from scratch. Don't believe me? [**Here's sneak peek of the "React Internals" chapter I wrote via a Twitter thread where I build `useState` in Vanilla JS**](https://twitter.com/crutchcorn/status/1527059744392814592).

## When does it release?

This book is still currently in production, and as such won't be available immediately. If you want early access to the book
while it's being worked on, feel free to [reach out to me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/crutchcorn/).

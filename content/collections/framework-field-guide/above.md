## Why learn React, Angular, **and** Vue?!

By learning React, Angular, and Vue all at once you gain:
- The ability to choose the right tool for the job
- Deeper understanding of core concepts
- Insight into different programming methodologies
- Appreciation for the "why" behind framework tradeoffs
- Superpowers to learn new(er) tools faster

Don't want to learn all three? **That's okay.** You can easily select a single framework and use this book to learn it front-to-back.

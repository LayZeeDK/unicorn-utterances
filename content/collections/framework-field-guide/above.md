## Why learn React, Angular, **and** Vue?!

By learning React, Angular, and Vue all at once you gain:
- Deeper understanding of core concepts than you'd have by only learning one framework
- Insight into different programming methodologies
- Appreciation for the "why" behind framework tradeoffs
- A superpower to learn similar UI frameworks much faster

Don't want to learn all three? **That's okay.** You can easily select a single framework and use this book to learn it front-to-back.
